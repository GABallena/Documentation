\section*{ ARG-MGE.smk}
\section*{Stage: Draft}   
\section*{General Purpose}

This pipeline is designed for \textbf{comprehensive metagenomic analysis of ARGs}, it also includes placeholders for analyses of \textbf{mobile genetic elements (MGEs)}, and \textbf{plasmid detection}. It integrates tools for \textbf{read quality control, assembly, annotation, taxonomic profiling, and structural variant (SV) detection} to provide a high-resolution view of the genetic components in metagenomic samples.

\section*{Specifics:}
\begin{itemize}
	\subsection*{Preprocessing}
	\item \textbf{It first uses \texttt{PEAR} to merge paired-end reads.}\\
	\textbf{Technical Notes}: \texttt{PEAR (Paired-End reAd mergeR)} compares paired-reads to correct infer the likely  bases on its associated pair\\
	\textbf{Rationale}: The main goal here is to ensure good read quality for downstream analyses and to maximize the amount of data by reducing gaps in the sequence and improving confidence of base calls within that region.\\
	\textbf{Note:} Another tool, \texttt{PandaSeq} which does the same thing is used later, this usage of \texttt{PEAR} here is because it is more optimized for larger datasets - which in this case are trimmed reads.
	
	\item \textbf{Followed by conversion from \texttt{FASTQ} to \texttt{FASTA} using \texttt{seqtk}.}\\
	\textbf{Technical Notes}: \texttt{seqtk} converts compressed \texttt{FASTQ} files to \texttt{FASTA}. \\
	\textbf{Rationale}: Some tools cannot work on \texttt{FASTQ} formats.
	
	\item \textbf{Translation of the \texttt{CARD-protein homologues database} \texttt{transeq}, and then reverse-translates these proteins to nucleotides for alignment.}\\
	\textbf{Technical Notes}: \texttt{transeq} from \texttt{EMBOSS} translates nucleotide sequences to protein sequences based on \textbf{standard genetic code}. \texttt{backtranseq} reverses this to allow iterative alignments with nucleotide sequences. \\
	\textbf{Rationale}: This leverages conserved protein-level information, which is lost at the nucleotide level due to synonymous mutations - while also increasing the sensitivity to potential ARG proteins from k-mer alignment. See Nature Methods, doi: doi.org/10.1038/s41592-019-0437-4 (2019) for more details.
	
	\subsection*{Metagenomic assembly of ARG-contigs}
		
	\item \textbf{Iterative alignment is performed using \texttt{KMA} to align reads against reverse-translated CARD sequences for high-sensitivity identification.}\\
	\textbf{Technical Notes}: \texttt{KMA} (K-mer Alignment) is used find the reverse-translated ARGs with the proximity filtering option to determine the surrounding regions of ARGs. This is done iteratively for each gene increasing the ARG-associated database. \\
	\textbf{Rationale}: Firstly, \texttt{KMA} is used because, unlike \texttt{Bowtie2} and \texttt{BWA-MEM}, which were created specifically for Human metagenomics, KMA does not suffer (or suffers less) from multi-allelic databases. Secondly, iterative alignment using this process allows us to contextualize the region wherein ARGs reside - thereby narrowing our focus onto these local regions instead of looking at the global genomic context.
	\textbf{Notes:} The script is designed to have a cap on the number of iterations KMA creates, increasing the database size. 
	
	\item \textbf{Merging ARG-related reads database with \texttt{PANDASeq}.}\\
	\textbf{Technical Notes}: \texttt{PANDASeq} is then used to further refine the paired-reads collated in the ARG-related genes database. \\
	\textbf{Rationale}: \texttt{PANDASeq} was chosen as, while being slower than \texttt{PEAR}, it is more accurate. This mergins step is included to ensure that only high-confidence reads are assembled. 
	\textbf{Note:} We leverage the fact that the ARG-related genes database is smaller compared to the raw metagenomic reads database.
	
	\item \textbf{Merged reads are assembled into contigs using \texttt{metaSPAdes}.}\\
	\textbf{Technical Notes}: \texttt{metaSPAdes} is then used to create contiguous sequences from these local regions by extending them using reads from the whole metagenomic pool. Additionally, Contigs are filtered by length here to remove possible artefacts. \\
	\textbf{Rationale}: \texttt{metaSPAdes} was chosen as, while being slower than \texttt{MEGAHIT}, it is optimized in handling highly diverse and mixed microbial populations. CARD is used here because it is manually curated and updated regularly - in order to be included in the database, there must be clinical data (e.g. ASTs(Antimicrobial susceptibility testing)) involved in the study.
\\	 \textbf{Notably, this would decrease the sensitivity of our ARGs - and would mostly be biased towards those reported in the clinical setting}. To counter this, we could also incorporate other tools such as \texttt{ResFinder}, the \texttt{NCBI AMR Database}, and \texttt{ARG-ANNOT}
\\	\textbf{Notes:} Filtering of contig length is handled by a python script that determines the minimum ARG sequence dictated by \texttt{CARD}.
\\	\textbf{Notes:} Contigs are further extended using contigextender to form scaffolds 
\\	\textbf{Notes:} Might add other contig extendending programs like \texttt{GapFiller} - which leverages mate-pair information 
	
	\item \textbf{\texttt{Python} script is created to do another round of checking contig quality for downstream analysis, \texttt{R} scripts are used to visualize the data.} \\
	\textbf{Technical Notes}: The \texttt{Python} script will measure standard contig quality metrics e.g. N50, L50 etc. \\
	\textbf{Rationale}: Should be obvious why
	
	\item \textbf{Confirmation of contigs with ARGs using \texttt{RGI}.}\\
	\textbf{Technical Notes}: \texttt{RGI} scan the contigs and check whether which contigs created by \texttt{metaSPAdes} have ARGs in them. \\
	\textbf{Rationale}: \texttt{metaSPAdes} may have created contigs that DO NOT contain ARGs, and have instead assembled them into a more matching contig (a false-positive misassembly) - this can happen because of the different databases being used; also parallelization of methods like this increases robustness because it has been confirmed independently from different starting points (bottom-up vs top-down approach). This allows us to filter ARG-containing contigs. \\
	\textbf{Notes:} \texttt{RGI} is the official scanner of \texttt{CARD}.
	
	\subsection*{Read-mapping}
		\item \textbf Checking coverage statistics on contigs using raw reads\\
	\textbf{Technical Notes}: \texttt{Samtools} is used here to map the raw reads from the larger database back to the assembled contigs and then calculates the coverage over the entire contig. \\
	\textbf{Rationale}: Read-mapping is a quality control protocol used in metagenomics, to determine the quality of the assembly. High-coverage means that many of the k-mers align well with that region of the contig, while low coverage is evidence of inconsistent mapping and that the contigs should be refined, split, or discarded.
\\	\textbf{Note} If there are persistent (after further refinement and reassemblies) sudden differences in coverage across a contig, that contig could be chimeric, meaning, it could be from two different populations. 
\\ \textbf{Extra note} A \texttt{Python} script is included in the pipeline that is determine visualize and check how the coverage changes over contig regions. In general, they could be interpreted as the following:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\textbf {Smooth, Uniform Coverage}: Typically shown by well-assembled contigs. \\
		\textbf {Sharp Coverage Drop}: May need to be split or flagged for reassembly. May also be a misassembly point (chimeric contitg) or caused by a structural variant  \\
		\textbf {Coverage Gaps}: Regions with little to no read support; a strong indicator of misassembly. \\
		\textbf {Gradual Drops}: Overlapping reads, repetitive or duplicate regions, partial HGT, sequence heterogeneity, or coverage differences due to a mixed population. Repeats and duplications can be filtered out using tools like \texttt{RepeatMasker} or \texttt{BLAST} \\\textbf{(to be added to the script)} \\
		\textbf {Sharp increase}: May be due to repetitive or duplicated regions, the assembler decided to collapse all the reads into that one contig, amplification bias from PCR, HGT, SV, chimeras.
	\end{enumerate}
 
		\subsubsection{Read mapping more details}
	\textbf {Read mapping tools} \\
	\textbf{Technical Notes}: Four (4) Tools will be used in parallel to do the read mapping process \texttt{BWA} \texttt{Bowtie} \texttt{KMA}, and \texttt{minimap2}, their parameters have been adjusted to map reads at 95 \% identity to the contigs.  \\

		\end{tabular}
	\end{adjustbox}
	\caption{Example table of mapper configurations without command example}
	\label{tab:mapper_configurations}
\end{table}
	
	\textbf{Rationale}: 95 \% identity is used to increase sensitivity - as is standard for determining homologous sequences. This adjustment was made because k-mers are either attach or don't. Parallelization is used to increase robusness.\\
	\textbf{Note} K-mer extension is used to increase the accuracy of mapping. \texttt{BWA} k-mer lengths can be adjusted, while \texttt{KMA} does it by default. The others, cannot be adjusted. \\

	\begin{tcolorbox}[title=Note (\today)]
		I chose to change the script to not allow gaps during this phase as we already used reverse translation earlier to correct for synonymous codons, and protein sequences are more important when it comes to ARG function, the new values are below. I also added protein-based read mapping.

\end{table}

\textbf{Rationale}: The main rationale for adding a protein-based read mapping protocol is because ARGs are primarily about their \textit{\textbf{protein-protein interactions}} (biological relevance). This method also accounts for frameshifts with higher specificity to homologous regions. \\
\textbf{On a personal note}: This approach may also require further exploration into whether protein-protein interactions are altered—perhaps by investigating changes in binding sites. Which is a story for another day (\textit{\textbf{why do I do this to myself?}})
\\





	\subsection*{Contiguous chimeras}
	
	\item \textbf{On a parallel process: taxonomic profiling is done using \texttt{Kraken2} and \texttt{SprayNPray}. and aligned with the ARG-raw reads and ARG-contigs databases}\\
	\textbf{Technical Notes}: \texttt{Kraken2} uses k-mer-based classification to assign taxonomy based on raw-reads. While \texttt{SprayNPray} complements this by assigning taxonomy at contig level. \\
	\textbf{Rationale}: By assigning comparing their respective databases with our ARG-related databases we will be able to connect our reads and/or contigs to their corresponding taxa, uncovering the microbial hosts responsible for carrying and potentially spreading ARGs in the environment.
	
	\item \textbf{Detects structural variants (SVs) in contigs using \texttt{Manta} and identifies \textit{chimeric contigs} based on SVs and taxonomic classification.}\\
	\textbf{Technical Notes}: \texttt{Manta} identifies large genomic rearrangements such as insertions, deletions, and duplications. \\
	\textbf{Rationale}: Chimeric contigs may be due to systematic error or real biological signals. These chimeric contigs can be detected by \texttt{Kraken2} and \texttt{SprayNPray} (i.e.) when a portion of a contig is being assigned to different taxa. The rationale behind this step is to investigate whether structural variations are present - which may be evidence of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events. 
	
	\item \textbf{Or perhaps due to mobile genetic elements like transposons}\\
	\textbf{Technical Notes}: Tools such as the following can be used:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \texttt{HMMER3} suite
		\item \texttt{Tnppred} - a transposon predictor tool
		
	\end{itemize}
	
	\textbf{Rationale}: 
	
	
	
	\item \textbf{\texttt{Sketching} contigs followed by calculating \texttt{Bray-Curtis} diversity.}\\
	\textbf{Technical Notes}: \texttt{Mash Sketch} uses a MinHash approach to generate a presence/absence profile of ARGs across contigs. This gives us a quick snapshot of what the contigs “look like” in terms of ARG content. For \texttt{Bray-Curtis} diversity, we calculate a dissimilarity matrix from the abundance data of ARGs, followed by a PCoA plot to visualize similarities between contigs based on their ARG profiles. \\
	\textbf{Rationale}: The \texttt{Mash Sketch} helps rapidly identify the genetic makeup of contigs in terms of ARGs, which provides a foundation for further investigation. By applying \texttt{Bray-Curtis} diversity and using PCoA, we can group contigs based on their ARG similarity. If contigs with the same sketch group together, we can trace them back to their taxonomic IDs to identify the microbial hosts.However, if contigs have similar ARG profiles but belong to different taxa, this could serve as \textbf{evidence for \textbf{Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT)}}. This dual approach allows us to trace ARG spread and potential HGT events in a metagenomic context. \\
	\textbf{Note} \texttt{Bray-Curtis} (dis-)similarity is most often used as a presence or absence diversity metric.
	

\subsection*{Plasmids}


	\item \textbf{Determination of putative plasmids}\\
	\textbf{Technical Notes}: The tools listed below will be used in parallel. Plasmids are considered valid when all 4 tools predict plasmid signatures in the contig.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \texttt{PlasPredict} pipeline
		\item \texttt{Recycler}
		\item \texttt{PlasmidFinder}
		\item \texttt{MOBSuite} plasmid marker annotator
	\end{itemize}
	If plasmid signatures are present, \texttt{plasmidSPAdes} along with \texttt{GapFiller} will be used to check if the contig can circularize. \texttt{oriTfinder} will then be applied to contigs with fewer than 4 fragments. A \texttt{Python} script will calculate GC skews of the chimeric contig and compare it to its taxonomic counterparts. Another \texttt{Python} script will normalize the data according to \texttt{16S rRNA} from trimmed reads. Lastly, plasmid percentage will be calculated based on reads mapped to putative plasmids over the total reads.
	
	\textbf{Equation}:
	\[
	\text{Plasmid Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Plasmid Reads}}{\text{Total Reads}} \right) \times 100
	\]

	\textbf{Rationale}: \texttt{oriTfinder} looks for \texttt{origin of transfer} sites (\texttt{oriT}), which are characteristics of conjugative plasmid . This whole sub-pipeline is to look for evidence of conjugative plasmid transfer as the cause of these chimeric contigs. Normalization and percentage counts are used here to further check whether these "plasmids" align with our understanding of the average plasmid copy number. \\
	\textbf{Note}: Will also be drafting a script to do sliding window analysis of \texttt{GC-skews} - as different characteristics of this curve can be interpreted in different ways. 

\subsection*{Phages}		
	
\item \textbf{Phage influence signatures}\\
\textbf{Technical Notes}: They will be determined using a variety of tools:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \texttt{VirSorter}: Identifies viral signatures within microbial genomes and separates prophages from bacterial sequences.
	\item \texttt{PHASTER}: A web-based tool for phage search and annotation, identifying integrated prophages.
	\item \texttt{VIBRANT}: A tool that combines several approaches to identify and annotate phage elements in metagenomic sequences.
\end{itemize}



\textbf{Rationale}:This analysis aims to detect potential phage signatures in the chimeric contigs. Since phages are mobile genetic elements, their involvement in transferring ARGs through transduction is highly relevant.Phages, especially temperate phages, can integrate into bacterial genomes and excise themselves, sometimes carrying host genetic material, such as ARGs, with them.The integration and excision signatures detected in contigs will provide evidence of possible transduction events in our datasets, supporting the hypothesis of ARG dissemination via phages.


\item \textbf{Phage Signature Extraction and Phylogenetic Analysis}\\
\textbf{Technical Notes}: Phage-associated genes will be extracted from the chimeric contigs, followed by phylogenetic analysis to uncover evolutionary relationships.\texttt{FastTree} will be used to build a phylogenetic tree based on the extracted phage genes.For visualization, tools like \texttt{iTOL} or \texttt{FigTree} can be used to generate an interpretable phylogenetic tree.


\textbf{Rationale}:Phage genes embedded in chimeric contigs (their taxonomy) may serve as strong evidence of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events. The aim here is to check the evolutionary origins of the phage genes found in our dataset and their potential involvement in the dissemination of ARGs.


\textbf{Future Considerations}: 
Will continue improving this section (everything regarding HGT) by evaluating the results from these tools, aligning them with ARG presence, and refining the approach for identifying conjugation, transposon, and transduction events within chimeric contigs. This may also involve validating phage activity—\textit{again, why do I do this to myself?}

\section*{Stage: Done}   
\section*{General Purpose taxo-metagenomics}

This pipeline is designed for \textbf{The essentials in metagenomics}, which includes \textbf{quality checking, filtering, and trimming of raw reads to clean reads}. As well as the usual \textbf{taxo-metagenomic analysis}. 

\section*{Specifics:}


\subsection*{Quality control (Pre-processing)}		

\textbf{Raw trimming of raw metagenomic data} 
\\ \textbf{Technical Notes}: \texttt{FastQC} is used on \textbf{raw reads}
\\ \textbf{Rationale}: This is mainly used as a point of comparison - determine whether the next step (trimming) was effective. This pre-processing step is the starting point in any and all metagenomics pipelines. 
\\ \textbf{Notes}: This whole quality control steps are interconnected with each other. \\
\\ 
\\
\textbf{Trimming} 
\\ \textbf{Technical Notes}: \texttt{Trimmomatic} is used on \textbf{raw reads}
\\ \textbf{Rationale}: Trimming involves removing low quality bases (often depending on something called the Phred Score - which is just a measure of how "confident" we are that the base on that site was accurate), adapters, and filtering reads that go below a specific length threshold. 
\\ \textbf{Notes}: Journals often report the parameters on \texttt{Trimmomatic} (or any trimmer they decide to use); this is often so that the study is reproducible, should one decide to actually reproduce the study starting from scratch (raw reads). 
\\ \textbf{Notes}: There are many different trimmers each with their own strengths and weaknesses, \texttt{Trimmomatic} is just the most popular trimmer and is thus used here, though studies differ in the parameters they used for trimming - which often dictates how strict they are with what they define as "good enough". \\
\\ \textbf{Perspective}: Why different people choose different trimmers depend on the \textbf{strengths and weaknesses} of the trimmer e.g. trimmers like "fastp" is used because it's fast making it suitable for very large datasets like deep sequencing. While some trimmers like \texttt{Sickle} has automatic adjustment over the entire sequence - which makes it useful for very ancient datasets where DNA is often highly-degraded. Other times, it's for \textbf{convenience} like \texttt{Trim-Galore} which combines \texttt{FastQC} and \texttt{Cutadapt} trimmer in a single command. Another good example is \texttt{BBDuk} which is part of a larger package called \texttt{BBtools}, \texttt{BBDuk} also has an built-in contamination detection - so it's particularly good at filtering out usual contaminants like sequences known to be from the human genome. so you can simply just use all the modules in that package for all-in-one processing.  Other times, it's just \textbf{familiarity}. 
\\\\
\textbf{Quality checks of post-trimmed data} 
\\ \textbf{Technical Notes}: \texttt{FastQC} is used on \textbf{trimmed reads} to determine how effective the trimming process was. 
\\ \textbf{Rationale}: If the trimming process was effective, we should notice a better quality reads here, otherwise, we might have to adjust the trimming parameters. 
\\ \textbf{Notes}: Determination of whether the trimmed reads are "clean enough" is more of an art rather than actual science, though thresholds exist like Phred $>$ 20 or Phred $>$ 30 depending on how strict you are as a researcher. \\
\\ 
\\

\subsection*{Metagenomic Taxonomy}	
\textbf{Taxonomy from Cleaned Reads} 
\\ \textbf{Technical Notes}: \texttt{Kraken2} is used on \textbf{raw reads} to determine which species they came from. 
\\ \textbf{Rationale}: Taxonomy based on reads is standard on metagenomics instead of using assembled contigs because information is lost during the assembly process. By using cleaned reads we make sure that: 
	 \begin{enumerate}
	 	\item We are maximizing the amount of data
	 	\item We are not being biased by low quality reads
	 \end{enumerate}
\textbf{Notes}: There are many ways in which taxonomy is assigned to raw reads the \texttt{Kraken-based} packages use a curated database that links k-mers from your database to k-mers generated from their database (usually manually curated).  
\\ \textbf{Notes}: Others like \texttt{MetaPhlan} first create "markers" that are based off of known sequences, and then scan your raw reads for these markers, which it then checks for under what taxon/taxa that marker fell under. \\

\subsection*{Diversity analysis}	
\textbf{Diversity analysis per site or sample} 
\\ \textbf{Technical Notes}: Here \texttt{Bracken} - an extension of the \texttt{Kraken} packages or \texttt{Qiime2} are often used to calculate diversity. Instead I opted to create my own \texttt{Python} script because:
	 \begin{enumerate}
	\item I find that the diversity indices in either tools are limited to only the most often used i.e. the most popular indices - so it is not comprehensive
	\item I've had problems integrating them into the pipeline because some dependency limitations, un-updated scripts, and a pre-processing step that requires converting all of \texttt{Kraken2, Bracken} files, then importing them to \texttt{Qimme2} which is too time-consuming and inefficient - my script just automatically calulates from \texttt{Bracken} outputs and just puts out all the possible (non-phylogenetic-based-which you would need a phylogenetic tree to build first) indices out there.  
	\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Rationale}: Taxonomy based on reads is standard on metagenomics instead of using assembled contigs because information is lost during the assembly process. By using cleaned reads we make sure that: 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item We are maximizing the amount of data
	\item We are not being biased by low quality reads
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Notes}: There are many ways in which taxonomy is assigned to raw reads the \texttt{Kraken-based} packages use a curated database that links k-mers from your database to k-mers generated from their database (usually manually curated).  
\\ \textbf{Notes}: Others like \texttt{MetaPhlan} first create "markers" that are based off of known sequences, and then scan your raw reads for these markers, which it then checks for under what taxon/taxa that marker fell under. \\

\section*{trim\_randomizer.smk}
\section*{Stage: Done}   
\section*{Purpose: Randomization of trimming parameters}

This is a module that will be part of a bigger pipeline. The idea here to is randomize parameters in a variety of trimmers in this case \texttt{Trimmomatic},
\texttt{fastp}, \texttt{CutAdapt}, \texttt{BBDuk}, and \texttt{Sickle} - famous bioinformatics trimming tools. \texttt{Trimmomatic} and \texttt{Sickle} in particular are widely used in \texttt{Illumina}-based data.\\ 
\\
\textbf{Random Parameter Generation}
\\ \textbf{Technical Notes}: Random parameters are generated for each trimming tool (Trimmomatic, Fastp, Cutadapt, BBDuk, Sickle). This is done using the \texttt{random module}, which creates random values for parameters such as quality scores, read length, adapter sequences, and error rates. These parameters are stored in the \texttt{generated\_parameters} dictionary to ensure consistency across iterations for each sample.\\
\textbf{Rationale}:By randomizing parameters, the workflow allows for testing different parameter sets across multiple iterations to find optimal settings for trimming and quality control.
\\ \textbf{Notes}: This approach helps with parameter exploration, particularly when you are unsure which trimming settings will give the best results. The randomness provides variability, which can highlight which parameters consistently lead to good results.
  \\
\\ 
\textbf{Log Parameters to a \texttt{TSV} File}
\\ \textbf{Technical Notes}: Each set of generated parameters is logged into a separate TSV file (e.g., \texttt{trimmomatic\_params.tsv}, \texttt{fastp\_params.tsv}). The file headers are written only once, and parameters are appended as the trimming steps proceed. This is done in a structured way so that you can track the exact parameters used for each sample and iteration.\\
\textbf{Rationale}:Logging ensures reproducibility and transparency in bioinformatics workflows. Having a record of all the parameter values used in each iteration is crucial for comparing results and for future reference
\\ \textbf{Notes}: This practice is a standard in scientific workflows where random parameter generation is involved. It helps maintain a clear audit trail of the steps performed and aids in troubleshooting or refining workflows later.
  \\
\\ 
\textbf{Define \texttt{Rules} for Each Tool}
\\ \textbf{Technical Notes}: The script uses \texttt{Snakemake rules} to define separate rules for each tool which include
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Input folder (as the script is designed to go through all the \texttt{FASTQ} samples within the folder)
		\item Output folder, where the processed files will be saved (e.g., trimmed paired and unpaired reads). The script is designed to keep all the \texttt{trimmed reads} in separate files. 
		\item Params: Fetches the parameters to be randomized. 
	\end{enumerate} 
\textbf{Rationale}:Using Snakemake here allows for parallel execution of the workflow. This parallelization if very important as the generation of random paramaters is created using a random \texttt{seed}. Using a random \texttt{seed} like this allows us to replicate what the parameters that had the optimal results were by tracking down what seed was assigned as dictated in the \texttt{TSV} file.\\
\textbf{Note} keep in mind that this will create a large number of folders if you decide to iterate many times - as each iteration, per tool, will have its own folder full of trimmed reads, per sample/site.
  \\
\\ 
\textbf{Interpretation and Analysis of Results (TBA)}
\\ \textbf{Technical Notes}: Once all iterations have completed, the trimmed files can be analyzed to determine which parameters led to the best results in terms of quality and length distribution of reads. There are many different metrics that can be used to interpret the results, including (but not limited to)

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Quality Scores - significant differences in quality among sites and across entire sequences (Phred score, Contamination, Adapter Removal, N Content, Length Distribution, etc.). Can be done using tools like \texttt{FastQC}
	\item Visualization can be done using \texttt{Rstudio} or \texttt{Python's matplotlib} to visually look for differences in abnormalities. 
\end{enumerate} 
\textbf{Rationale}:Evaluating read quality and assessing key metrics post-trimming helps to ensure that the data is suitable for downstream analyses. Optimal trimming should maximize the number of high-quality, usable reads while eliminating low-quality bases and adapter contamination.\\
\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10!white, coltitle=white, colframe=gray!80!black, title=A Personal Note]
	I have long pondered upon the idea of creating a graph with \texttt{biological information} on the y-axis and \texttt{read length} on the x-axis. I hypothesize that we will find a \textbf{"sweet spot" }wherein we can optimize the amount of \texttt{information/read} using such trimmers. Unfortunately, it is extremely difficult to define what \texttt{a biological sequence} really is, because technically you can generate any random sequence - whether protein or nucleotide. That's the main reason I have been stuck on this problem for quite a while, I've been trying to find the answer first.
	
	The core difficulty here lies in defining what constitutes biological information in a meaningful, quantifiable way. Since any random sequence of nucleotides or proteins could be technically "valid" (false-positives). 
	
	When people are asked this question they often give \textbf{DESCRIPTIONS} of what a \texttt{biological sequence} is but not what \textbf{DEFINES} a \texttt{biological sequence}. I understand that there are many characteristics that can help in determining the signal from the noise, but I am just not satisfied with whether this "thing" checks most (if not all) the boxes - I need a non-subjective answer to this problem. 
\end{tcolorbox}
